> <h3>Description üéä</h3> 
<p>Translating from portuguese, "SiteBiblioteca" means a library website. This was my first project ever made, and also, it was used as my final paper to a certificate program in systems development.</p>

In summary, it is a site for managing a library, with the following functionalities:
1. Sign up, sign in and sign out of users and password recovery;
2. The user's profile with their loans of books in progress and history of their returnings;
3. The exhibition of the collection of books available;
4. The loan and return of books by the administrator; 
5. The reservation and renewal of the book by the user;
6. Registration of ebooks and download option;
7. School supplies for download.

> <h3>Tutorial üéÅ</h3>
<p>If you want to use it, you can download the zipped folder and open it in your browser. To do this,
you'll need a localserver and PHP installed in your computer.</p>
<p>Inside the folder you'll find a file named "banco de dados", opening it you'll find another file
named "bdbiblioteca.sql", that is the whole database of the project. </p>

<br>

> <h3>Tecnologies üíª</h3> 
- The languages used were HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, JavaScript and the Jquery library, focusing on PHP - JavaScript was only used for front-end animations.
- The website also has a database, which is MySQL from WampServer. 
- The website Figma was used to elaborate the design.
- Visual Studio Code was used to write the code.

> <h3>Challenges during the process üí£</h3>
<p>The duration of the project lasted about 6 months, time made available by the certificate program, because it was the first students' contact with practical programming.</p>
<p>It was time to grab the knowledge obtained and turn it into something concrete, something extremely challenging that required of a lot of research in forums, with colleagues and teachers.</p>
<p>At the end, the result obtained was rewarding: approval of the project by the evaluators and the certificate in my hands of the newly completed program.</p>
